What is Corvid?
===============

Corvid is a tool that helps you make websites.  Specifically, Corvid helps you
generate **static websites** [#staticsite]_.  You can use Corvid to create a
website with your own custom pages and blog articles.  When you're ready, you
can download your entire website as a ZIP file that you can give to your hosting
provider.

.. [#staticsite] What is a static website?  Well, many websites (like Facebook
                 and Twitter) display constantly updating content.  In order to
                 do that, they need to write very complex code and sophisticated
                 web servers.  These are dynamic websites.  Static sites display
                 simple content that never changes (without you deploying a new
                 version of the site).

Who Should Use Corvid?
----------------------

Anyone can use Corvid.  Corvid is especially useful for small businesses and
organizations that can't afford to pay a developer to create a website.  You can
make a simple site with a few pages (like home page, about us, contact us,
etc).  You can even create a blog for announcements.  Finally, you can choose a
theme that fits your company's image.

If you're an individual, you might want to use Corvid because of its especially
strong support for blogging!  Corvid is actually an interface to a powerful
blogging tool called Pelican.  You can create a personal website with ease.
Blog posts can be organized into categories, and you can write your posts using
the simple Markdown format with an advanced in-browser editor.
