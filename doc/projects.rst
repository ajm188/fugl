All About Projects
==================

As you've probably learned so far, Projects are how you create websites.
Projects contain the following things:

- Pages: content with information about your site
- Posts: frequently updated blog posts
- Categories: categories to organize your blog posts
- Project Plugins: features that affect the behavior of your whole site (for
  instance, Google Analytics can be used as a Project Plugin).
- Page Plugins: features that affect the behavior of particular pages or posts
  (for instance, Disqus comments or social media buttons).

From your account home, you can create new projects from scratch.  You can also
duplicate existing projects using the "Clone" button (it looks like two sheets
of paper).  Finally, you can delete projects using the Delete button (it looks
like a trash can).

When you download your project, we use a tool called Pelican to convert your
project into a bunch of files that come together to form a website.  Then we zip
it up and give it to you as a download.
